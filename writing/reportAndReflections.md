Question 8.

<!-- What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article
which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines? -->
The damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article that incorrectly assumes autism is a result of vaccines cause people to not vaccinate their children. By doing so, they think they are preventing their kids from developing autism and keeping them safe, when in reality, they are doing the complete opposite. People who do not vaccinate their children are putting their children at risk for diseases such as measles, chickenpox, mumps, etc. Moreover, they are putting other people’s children along with other citizens at risk to contracting these diseases and causing outbreaks.

published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before
public exposure? -->

<!-- The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content.
Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the
damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough? -->

Question 9.

<!-- During the talk concerning Global Health, given by Dr. Becky Dawson and Dr. Amelia
Finaret on Friday, 28 th September, one of the main points is that data is used to fight disease
and to track out-breaks of serious ailments in diverse communities all over the world. Find
two sets of (publicly available) data from the World Health Organization which could be used
in a project to determine whether vaccines are beneficial, in any capacity. -->

Question 10.

<!-- Write your reactions to the talk and discuss an idea which resonated with you.  -->
An idea which resonated with me was the story about morning sickness and its relation to a good pregnancy. The speakers talked about how all these studies and all this data comes out saying things like “coffee does this during pregnancy” or “red wine does this during pregnancy” or “morning sickness equals this type of pregnancy”. People immediately associate these things together when they sometimes should not. The speakers stated that having morning sickness actually leads for a better pregnancy. This is because people who have morning sickness are not able to eat or drink anything for at least the morning, and sometimes into the day. This means that they can also not drink coffee, which has caffeine, that negatively affects pregnant women. The speakers stated that people associate morning sickness with higher chance of miscarriage, when in reality, it prevents women from drinking coffee which is what actually leads to pregnancy complications. This especially resonated with me because recently, my Aunt gave birth to a boy who tragically passed away later that week. The doctors were not sure what had caused the complications, and were blaming things like her health. I am curious to see some of the data from the autopsy that shows what caused this, and to see how it associates with other data that is out in the world and makes connections to things like this.
