Question 7.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720046/
https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination

These two articles talk about how the refusal of vaccines is consequential to the eradication of diseases. Specifically, both articles have a section on smallpox, which is similar to measles, but caused by a different virus and requires a different vaccination. The general goal of these papers, and more, is to show people data that explores the benefits of vaccines, and how they prevent diseases and will (hopefully) ultimately eradicate these diseases altogether. In 1978, the final documented case of naturally developed smallpox was detected, 12 years after the program ratification to eradicate this disease. The program took around 150 years to rid of this disease completely, but ultimately did work. It is an extensive process to try and eradicate a disease completely from society, but over time and with studies proving why vaccinations are beneficial to this eradication process, the positive effects of vaccines will be publicly known, and eradication will happen. However, researchers who do studies and think they find data that says vaccines cause autism are slowing down this process. We took a large step backwards when this happened because more cases of these diseases we are trying to rid of popped up since parents were not vaccinating their children. This, although a step back, may ultimately be good in the long run for people to realize why they need vaccines, and why the effects are positive rather than negative. I am convinced by these articles because they both lead off by mentioning how the eradication of smallpox happened through the use of vaccines, and go on to explain how we are to do this with diseases prevalent in our society today. It just takes everyone to believe in the problem, and work towards a solution together and ultimately eradicate diseases that can be eradicated through vaccines.

<!-- What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article
which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines? -->
The damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article that incorrectly assumes autism is a result of vaccines cause people to not vaccinate their children. By doing so, they think they are preventing their kids from developing autism and keeping them safe, when in reality, they are doing the complete opposite. People who do not vaccinate their children are putting their children at risk for diseases such as measles, chickenpox, mumps, etc. Moreover, they are putting other people’s children along with other citizens at risk to contracting these diseases and causing outbreaks. It also prevents people from giving their kids the public medicine they need to survive and be healthy for the rest of their lives. Because of this data, their is a large population of people in the world who do not vaccinate their children, not because they cannot afford it or do not have the medicine available, but because they are afraid their children will develop autism because of a study that was not valid. Researchers need to ensure they have validated data before it is made openly available to the public in order to prevent these types of chaotic instances in society.

<!-- What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that
published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before
public exposure? -->
Academic research groups and organizations need to have more people look over and validate their data before it is published and publicly available. It is the duty of the people doing the research to have enough people look at their data and research, and validate it before it is published. If a researcher does some research, finds it to be alarming or interesting and simply pushes it out to the public, people go into a frenzy, like in the example above. To ensure it has been properly analyzed, the researcher must continuously show their findings to colleagues, other researches, and more people to examine it and be absolutely positive that the findings are in fact true. Without this credibility and assurance that the data is valid, researchers should not be allowed to make their data publicly available. Academic research groups and organizations should have the duty of receiving new data and findings, analyzing it themselves, and validating it numerous times before it is declared true and given to the public.

<!-- The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content.
Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the
damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough? -->
No, retracting his paper was not enough to fix the damage to public medicine, at least not yet. The damage is done in the sense that a large population of people chose not to vaccinate their kids, making them susceptible to diseases and putting other people at risk of getting diseases. People have died because they were not properly vaccinated, and that damage cannot be reversed. People thought they were doing the right thing and protecting their kids because of this researcher's study, when in reality they were ultimately doing much more harm than good. Additionally, people who saw this paper may still believe what the researcher published to be true. It is engraved in their minds that vaccines equal autism, whether or not the paper is still supported by the researcher. Their is a large divide in people who believe this and people who do not, which adds more problems to society in a political sense, but that is ultimately besides the point. The damage to public medicine is done, and the only way to fix it is with time, and accurate research. Over time, people will realize that this study was not true, and it will fade from society as time goes on. Also, researches proving that this study was false countless times will help fix the damage by showing people just how ridiculous it was to not vaccinate their children.

Question 9.

<!-- During the talk concerning Global Health, given by Dr. Becky Dawson and Dr. Amelia
Finaret on Friday, 28 th September, one of the main points is that data is used to fight disease
and to track out-breaks of serious ailments in diverse communities all over the world. Find
two sets of (publicly available) data from the World Health Organization which could be used
in a project to determine whether vaccines are beneficial, in any capacity. -->

 http://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/gshs/VEBH2003_public_use_codebook.pdf

These two publicly available data sets from the WHO could potentially be used in a project to determine whether vaccines are beneficial because they show statistics about students in two different parts of Venezuela and how they differ. The articles explain that "The GSHS is a relatively low-cost school-based survey which uses a self-administered questionnaire to obtain data on young people's health behavior and protective factors related to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adults worldwide." This can be applied to children who are vaccinated versus those who are not, and analyzed to produce some sort of study as to why vaccines are beneficial.

Question 10.

<!-- Write your reactions to the talk and discuss an idea which resonated with you.  -->
An idea which resonated with me was the story about morning sickness and its relation to a good pregnancy. The speakers talked about how all these studies and all this data comes out saying things like “coffee does this during pregnancy” or “red wine does this during pregnancy” or “morning sickness equals this type of pregnancy”. People immediately associate these things together when they sometimes should not. The speakers stated that having morning sickness actually leads for a better pregnancy. This is because people who have morning sickness are not able to eat or drink anything for at least the morning, and sometimes into the day. This means that they can also not drink coffee, which has caffeine, that negatively affects pregnant women. The speakers stated that people associate morning sickness with higher chance of miscarriage, when in reality, it prevents women from drinking coffee which is what actually leads to pregnancy complications. This especially resonated with me because recently, my Aunt gave birth to a boy who tragically passed away later that week. The doctors were not sure what had caused the complications, and were blaming things like her health. I am curious to see some of the data from the autopsy that shows what caused this, and to see how it associates with other data that is out in the world and makes connections to things like this.
